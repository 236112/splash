          The Original is a promotional primary weapon for the Soldier. It is
          based on the Rocket Launcher from the video game Quake; a bulky, tan
          rocket launcher with a metallic tubular exhaust port, metallic and tan
          handles, as well as a distinctive oversized barrel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This weapon functions nearly identically to the Rocket Launcher,
          except for a few minor changes. As with the Rocket Launcher in Quake,
          the Original's first-person view model is at the bottom-center of the
          screen, and its rockets are launched straight ahead of the Soldier, as
          opposed to being fired at an angle. The Soldier holds the weapon
          normally in third-person view. The Original also changes several
          standard weapon sound effects into sounds from the original Quake,
          such as the Rocket Launcher's switch, firing, and explosion sounds.
